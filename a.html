      <h1>Indian Economy: Growth, Challenges & Future Prospects</h1>
      <p>
        The Indian economy is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.
        It plays a significant role in global trade and commerce. This article
        delves into India's economic structure, major challenges, and its future
        trajectory.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Overview of the Indian Economy</h2>
      <p>
        India is the fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest
        by purchasing power parity (PPP). With a diverse industrial sector,
        robust agriculture, and a booming services sector, the economy continues
        to evolve rapidly.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Key Economic Indicators</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h3>
      <p>
        India's GDP is projected to grow at an annual rate of 6-7% in the coming
        years. The service sector contributes around 55%, while industry and
        agriculture make up the rest.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Employment & Workforce</h3>
      <p>
        With over 500 million workers, India has one of the world's largest
        labor forces. However, job creation and skill development remain key
        challenges.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Inflation & Fiscal Policies</h3>
      <p>
        Inflation in India fluctuates between 4-6%. The Reserve Bank of India
        (RBI) plays a crucial role in managing inflation through monetary
        policies.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Challenges Facing the Indian Economy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Unemployment:</strong> High youth unemployment rates remain a
          major concern.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infrastructure Deficit:</strong> Poor infrastructure slows
          down industrial and logistical growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Income Inequality:</strong> Economic disparity remains a
          pressing issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Uncertainties:</strong> Trade wars, oil prices, and
          geopolitical tensions affect Indiaâ€™s economy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Future Prospects & Government Initiatives</h2>
      <p>
        The government has launched various initiatives to boost economic
        growth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Make in India:</strong> Promoting domestic manufacturing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Digital India:</strong> Accelerating digital transformation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Startup India:</strong> Encouraging entrepreneurship.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Atmanirbhar Bharat:</strong> Aiming for self-reliance in key
          industries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Indian economy has immense potential for growth, but challenges like
        unemployment and infrastructure gaps must be addressed. With strategic
        reforms and investments, India is well on its way to becoming a global
        economic powerhouse.
